Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

The APIs client needs access token.
This client setup step is below.

```ruby
# set token by Calendly.configure methods.
Calendly.configure do |config|
  config.token            = '<ACCESS_TOKEN>'
  # follows are options. you can refresh access token if these are set.
  config.client_id        = '<CLIENT_ID>'
  config.client_secret    = '<CLIENT_SECRET>'
  config.refresh_token    = '<REFRESH_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
  config.token_expires_at = '<ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT>'
end
client = Calendly::Client.new


# set token by Calendly::Client initializer.
client = Calendly::Client.new '<ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

This client basic usage is below.

```ruby
# get a current user's information.
me = client.me
# => <Calendly::User uuid:U123456789>
me.scheduling_url
# => "https://calendly.com/your_name"

# get event_types
event_types, next_params = client.event_types me.uri
# => [[#<Calendly::EventType uuid:ET001>, #<Calendly::EventType uuid:ET002>, #<Calendly::EventType uuid:ET003>], nil]
event_types.first.scheduling_url
# => "https://calendly.com/your_name/30min"

# get scheduled events
events, next_params = client.events me.uri
# => => [[#<Calendly::Event uuid:EV001>, #<Calendly::Event uuid:EV002>, #<Calendly::Event uuid:EV003>], nil]
ev = events.first
ev.name
# => "FooBar Meeting"
ev.start_time
# => 2020-07-22 01:30:00 UTC
ev.end_time
# => 2020-07-22 02:00:00 UTC

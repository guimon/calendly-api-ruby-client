## Usage

The APIs client needs access token.
This client setup step is below.

```ruby
# set token by Calendly.configure methods.
Calendly.configure do |config|
  config.token            = '<ACCESS_TOKEN>'
  # follows are options. you can refresh access token if these are set.
  config.client_id        = '<CLIENT_ID>'
  config.client_secret    = '<CLIENT_SECRET>'
  config.refresh_token    = '<REFRESH_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
  config.token_expires_at = '<ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_AT>'
end
client = Calendly::Client.new


# set token by Calendly::Client initializer.
client = Calendly::Client.new '<ACCESS_TOKEN>'
```

This client basic usage is below.

```ruby
# get a current user's information.
me = client.me
# => <Calendly::User uuid:U001>
me.scheduling_url
# => "https://calendly.com/your_name"

# get all Event Types
event_types = me.event_types
# => [#<Calendly::EventType uuid:ET001>, #<Calendly::EventType uuid:ET002>, #<Calendly::EventType uuid:ET003>]
event_types.first.scheduling_url
# => "https://calendly.com/your_name/30min"

# get scheduled events
events = me.scheduled_events
# => => [#<Calendly::Event uuid:EV001>, #<Calendly::Event uuid:EV002>, #<Calendly::Event uuid:EV003>]
ev = events.first
ev.name
# => "FooBar Meeting"
ev.start_time
# => 2020-07-22 01:30:00 UTC
ev.end_time
# => 2020-07-22 02:00:00 UTC

# get organization information
own_member = me.organization_membership
# => #<Calendly::OrganizationMembership uuid:MEM001>
my_org = own_member.organization
all_members = my_org.memberships
# => [#<Calendly::OrganizationMembership uuid:MEM001>, #<Calendly::OrganizationMembership uuid:MEM002>]

# create new invitation and send invitation email
invitation = my_org.create_invitation('foobar@example.com')
# => #<Calendly::OrganizationInvitation uuid:INV001>
invitation.status
# => "pending"

# cancel the invitation
invitation.delete

# if the log level set :debug, you can get the request/response information.
Calendly.configuration.logger.level = :debug
invitation = my_org.create_invitation('foobar@example.com')
# D, [2020-08-10T10:48:15] DEBUG -- : Request POST https://api.calendly.com/organizations/ORG001/invitations params:, body:{:email=>"foobar@example.com"}
